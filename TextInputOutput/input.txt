    I have conducted a not very scientific audit. My conclusion is that 5G is not ready for mainstream adoption yet.

    The revolution began on 30 May when EE launched its 5G service in six cities. Vodafone swiftly followed, and then O2 switched on its service in mid-October.

    Three's 5G service is not yet available for mobile phones, but it offers a home broadband service in parts of London.
To get these services, you need a 5G phone or one of Three's home broadband routers, so I borrowed equipment from all four networks and started my programme of testing.
