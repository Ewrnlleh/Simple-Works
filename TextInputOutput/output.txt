    I have conducted a not very scientific audit. My conclusion is that VG is not ready for mainstream adoption yet.

    The revolution began on XXX May when EE launched its VG service in six cities. Vodafone swiftly followed, and then OII switched on its service in mid-October.

    Three's VG service is not yet available for mobile phones, but it offers a home broadband service in parts of London.
To get these services, you need a VG phone or one of Three's home broadband routers, so I borrowed equipment from all four networks and started my programme of testing.
